A service notification for Telegram that accepts icinga vars as arguments. This is mainly to workaround a limitation in Icinga Director which is unable to supply environment vars to scripts. This is picking up on the ideas of https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/pull/5170/commits, just my interpretation of this in golang.

This was a subdir of https://github.com/xunzi/monitoring now moved to its own repo, discarded the original commit history, the history of computing will have live without it.
